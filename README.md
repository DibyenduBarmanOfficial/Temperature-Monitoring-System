# Temperature-Monitoring-System
My Project in Microcontroller is Temperature Monitoring System using a 16X2 Liquid Crystal Display and LM35.

**The components used in the project are as follows:**

1. **Nucleo F401RE:** 
   - Description: Development board based on the STM32 microcontroller.
   - Purpose: Provides the platform for programming and controlling the temperature monitoring system.

2. **LM35:** 
   - Description: Analog temperature sensor.
   - Purpose: Measures the ambient temperature and provides the analog temperature value.

3. **16X2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):**
   - Description: Display module with two rows and 16 columns.
   - Purpose: Displays the temperature reading and other relevant information.

4. **Potentiometer:**
   - Description: Adjustable resistor.
   - Purpose: Used to control the contrast of the LCD display for better visibility.

5. **DigitalOut (Red LED):**
   - Description: Digital output pin connected to a red LED.
   - Purpose: Indicates high-temperature conditions by turning on the red LED.

6. **DigitalOut (Green LED):**
   - Description: Digital output pin connected to a green LED.
   - Purpose: Indicates normal temperature conditions by turning on the green LED.

7. **TextLCD Library:**
   - Description: Library for interfacing with text-based LCD displays.
   - Purpose: Provides convenient functions for controlling the LCD display and printing text.
