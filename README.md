   - Description: Analog temperature sensor.
   - Purpose: Measures the ambient temperature and provides the analog temperature value.

3. **16X2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):**
   - Description: Display module with two rows and 16 columns.
   - Purpose: Displays the temperature reading and other relevant information.

4. **Potentiometer:**
   - Description: Adjustable resistor.
   - Purpose: Used to control the contrast of the LCD display for better visibility.

5. **DigitalOut (Red LED):**
   - Description: Digital output pin connected to a red LED.

** Code explanation: How the code is working for the Temperature Monitoring System using a 16X2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and LM35
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Include necessary libraries:**
   - The code begins by including the required libraries, such as "mbed.h" for the mbed platform and "TextLCD.h" for interfacing with the LCD display.

2. **Define the components:**
   - Next, the code defines the necessary components used in the system. This includes creating objects for the LM35 temperature sensor (AnalogIn), the red LED (DigitalOut), the green LED (DigitalOut), and the LCD display (TextLCD).

3. **Main function:**
   - The main function is where the temperature monitoring system logic resides.

4. **Temperature measurement:**
   - Inside the main function, a while loop is used to continuously monitor the temperature.
   - The LM35 sensor value is read using the LM35.read() function, which returns a value between 0 and 1 representing the analog input voltage.
   - The LM35 sensor value is then converted to millivolts by multiplying it with 3300.
   - The millivolt value is divided by 10 to obtain the temperature in degrees Celsius.

5. **Display temperature on LCD:**
   - The lcd.locate() function is used to set the cursor position on the LCD to the desired column and row.
   - The lcd.printf() function is used to print the temperature value on the LCD display with two decimal places.
   - The lcd.putc() function is used to print the degree symbol (Â°) and the letter 'C' for Celsius.

6. **LED indication:**
   - Based on the temperature reading, the code checks if the temperature is greater than or equal to 25 degrees Celsius.
   - If the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, the red LED is turned on by setting RedLed = 1 and the green LED is turned off by setting GreenLed = 0.
   - If the temperature is below 25 degrees Celsius, the red LED is turned off by setting RedLed = 0 and the green LED is turned on by setting GreenLed = 1.

7. **Delay and LCD clearing:**
   - The code includes a wait(2) function to introduce a delay of 2 seconds between temperature readings.
   - After the delay, the lcd.cls() function is used to clear the LCD display, preparing it for the next temperature reading.

8. **Loop:**
   - The code continues to execute the while loop, continuously monitoring the temperature and updating the display and LED indication.

In summary, the code reads the temperature from the LM35 sensor, displays it on the LCD, and provides visual indication through the red and green LEDs based on the temperature threshold of 25 degrees Celsius. The system continuously repeats this process, providing real-time temperature monitoring on the LCD display.
